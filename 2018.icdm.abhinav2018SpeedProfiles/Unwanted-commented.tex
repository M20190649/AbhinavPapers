%TTEs for ride-hailing happen in two different phases, namely, pickup phase, which involves the driver picking up a passenger on being matched, and the drop off phase, which involves involves the passenger being dropped off to the requested destination. It is crucial that we estimate the travel times for the pickup phase since this has a huge impact on the which driver gets matched with which passenger.
%Ideally we would like to match the cab closest to a passenger. 
%Further, on being matched, the passenger is continuously shown how long it takes for the cab to reach her which must be as accurate as possible to prevent passenger cancellations and worse passenger churn. 
%The travel time for the drop off phase is crucial since the price for taking the cab is shown upfront. It is imperative that we get it right to avoid drivers being underpaid (driver churn is also a major concern considering the competitive environment) especially when they are stuck in traffic congestion during trips in peak hours.
